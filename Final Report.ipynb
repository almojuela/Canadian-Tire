    "For this final assignment, I will be focusing on the Canadian Tire Data from the months of May, June, and December. From analyzing the data given, these three months have shown to be the most popular months for Canadian Tire to be mentioned in tweets out of both years. June, consisting of 2940 mentions in both years, May, consisting of 2465 mentions, and December with Canadian Tire being mentioned or relating to it 2417 times. By analyzing the most popular months of both years, we are able to gather enough data to determine if the change of the Canadian Tire slogan has shifted tweets to be more positive or not.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Some of the problems with the data, however, circle around the notion that there are a number of columns that are empty for quite some time, making it hard for the reader to read some of the information. There also appears to be various columns that do not have much relevance to the data needed, and will most likely be taken out later on. For example, the 'user_id' column contains information about the user's ID number. Although this can help determine who a user might be, the data also provides their username, as well as their screen name, thereby  removing any relevance the user_id column may carry."
